        <h2>About Aloha Soda</h2>
        <section class="about-us">
            <p>Welcome to **Aloha Soda**! As a Polynesian, it’s a dream come true to share the love, mana, and rich culture of my people through this website and our drinks. Aloha Soda isn’t just a place to grab a refreshing soda — it’s a celebration of **Aloha**, **ohana**, and the joyful spirit of Polynesian hospitality.</p>
            
            <p>At **Aloha Soda**, we honor the values of **Aloha** — love, peace, and compassion — in every sip. Our menu is a vibrant reflection of the islands, with tropical fruit-inspired flavors and sweet treats that connect us to the heart of our Polynesian roots. Each drink tells a story, each flavor represents a part of our culture, and each visit is an invitation to experience the **mana** that flows from the land to your glass.</p>

            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Founded by **Meline Levao**, Aloha Soda is more than just a soda shop; it’s a dream to create a space where the spirit of **Aloha** can be shared through every interaction. Growing up with the warmth of Polynesian hospitality, I wanted to offer not just drinks but an experience where people could connect, relax, and share in the good vibes.</p>

            <p>The idea of Aloha Soda began as a small vision to combine the flavors of the islands with the warmth of Polynesian hospitality. With a passion for sharing the beauty and joy of my culture, I set out to craft sodas that taste like the islands — fresh, bold, and full of life. My hope is that every customer feels like a part of the Aloha family, no matter where they’re from or what their background is.</p>

            <h3>Our Values</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aloha Spirit</strong> – We embrace the essence of **Aloha** in every sip, interaction, and moment. Love and kindness are the foundation of our business.</li>
                <li><strong>Mana</strong> – The life force of Polynesia flows through everything we do. From our drinks to our service, we infuse everything with positive energy and respect for our culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Community</strong> – We believe in **ohana** — the concept of family. Here, everyone is treated like family, and we work together to support one another.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Pride</strong> – We honor the rich traditions of Polynesia in every detail of our shop and menu, blending old-world hospitality with modern flavors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Meet Meline Levao</h3>
            <p>I’m Meline Levao, the founder of **Aloha Soda**. I grew up in a small Polynesian community where the warmth of **Aloha** was always present. I learned early on that our culture is all about bringing people together, offering kindness, and sharing our love for life. With this inspiration, I created Aloha Soda — a space to share those values with the world, one soda at a time. My mission is simple: to create a welcoming space where anyone who walks through our doors can feel like part of the **ohana**. We’re not just serving drinks; we’re serving **Aloha**!</p>

            <h3>Our Ingredients</h3>
            <p>We believe in using fresh, natural ingredients to create our tropical sodas. From the juicy sweetness of mangoes to the rich, creamy flavors of coconut and vanilla, every ingredient is handpicked for its quality and flavor. Each drink is designed to bring a taste of the islands directly to you — from **Laie, Hawaii**, with love.</p>
